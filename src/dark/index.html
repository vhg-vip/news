                    <p class="content">Elon Musk has spent nearly two decades rallying SpaceX fans around his goal of
                        colonizing Mars, something world governments aren't currently attempting — in part because of
                        the unfathomable price tag such a mission will entail.<br><br>

                        Musk, the company's CEO and chief engineer, refers to his interplanetary ambitions more like a
                        sci-fi protagonist with a moral calling than an entrepreneur with a disruptive business plan.
                        "If there's something terrible that happens on Earth, either made by humans or natural, we want
                        to have, like, life insurance for life as a whole," Musk said during a virtual Mars conference
                        on Aug. 31. "Then, there's the kind of excitement and adventure."<br><br>
                        SpaceX's plans for a Red-Planet settlement bring up numerous technological, political and
                        ethical questions. One of the most challenging hurdles may also be financial: Not even Musk has
                        ventured to guess an all-in cost estimate.<br><br>
                        The last space program that came close to Musk's interplanetary travel ambitions was NASA's
                        Apollo program, the mid-20th Century effort that landed six spacecraft and 12 astronauts on the
                        moon. Apollo cost well over $280 billion in today's dollars, and, in some years, NASA was taking
                        up more than 4% of the entire national budget. The space agency, which in more recent years has
                        received less than half of one percent of the federal budget, is mapping its own plans to return
                        humans to the moon and, eventually, a path to Mars.
                        But the agency has not indicated how much the latter could cost, either.<br><br>

                        Musk's personal wealth has ballooned to about $100 billion — at least on paper — thanks in no
                        small part to a series of stock and stock awards from his electric car company, Tesla. Musk has
                        also repeatedly said that he hopes profits from SpaceX's other businesses, including a
                        satellite-internet venture that is currently in beta testing, will help fuel development of his
                        Mars rocket. SpaceX has also raised nearly $6 billion from banks and venture capitalists,
                        swelling into one of the most highly-valued private companies in the world, according to data
                        firm Pitchbook. Presumably, at least some investors will one day be looking to cash out.
